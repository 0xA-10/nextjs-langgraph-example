# nextjs-langgraph-example

A simplistic implementation of Next.js + assistant-ui + LangGraph message streaming.

The workflow is not meant to do anything, it's only meant to demonstrate the technology.

The assistant streams a response from the LangGraph workflow. The first node makes a streaming call to OpenAI. The second node waits 3 seconds then appends a greeting to the response.
